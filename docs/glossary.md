# Glossary

This glossary will grow as I learn.

## account
An account is an identity on Ethereum that can hold ETH and interact with the network. It can be a user wallet (controlled by a private key) or a smart contract account (controlled by code).

## transaction
A transaction is a signed message sent to the network that changes something, like sending ETH or calling a smart contract function. When included in a block, it can update balances or contract state.

## gas
Gas is the unit that measures how much computation or work a transaction uses. You pay for gas to prevent spam and to compensate the network for processing your transaction.

## block
A block is a bundle of transactions plus metadata, added to the blockchain in order. Blocks create a timeline of what happened and allow everyone to agree on the same history.

## state
State is the current snapshot of Ethereum, including account balances, contract code, and contract storage. Transactions move the state forward from one version to the next.

## smart contract
A smart contract is code deployed on Ethereum that runs when called by transactions. It can store data, enforce rules, and control funds according to its programmed logic.
